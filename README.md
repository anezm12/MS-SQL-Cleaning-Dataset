# MS-SQL-Cleaning-Dataset
Cleaning data project 

## Data Cleaning

In this project I tested my SQL skills by applying logic, Data Query Language  (DQL), and Data Definition Language (DDL).

Cleaning a dataset is essential for ensuring the data's accuracy, consistency, and reliability. By identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values, cleaning enhances the overall quality of the dataset. This process improves the accuracy of analysis, reduces biases, and ensures compliance with regulatory standards. Clean data enables organizations to make informed decisions, uncover meaningful insights, and drive business growth effectively.
